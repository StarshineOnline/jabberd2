jabberd2 (2.0s4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Users upgrading from a previous version of jabberd2-bdb (anything that
  used an older version of libdb) will need to manually recover their
  Berkeley databases.  This appears to be due to a problem with how
  Jabberd2 interacts with it's Berkeley database.  The database seems to
  be left in an unclean state when Jabberd2 shuts down.  This isn't a
  problem for normal operation, but when the version of the Berkeley
  database libraries changes the database isn't able to be automatically
  upgraded.

  You'll need the db4.1-util (assuming 4.1 was your previous version
  of libdb) package installed.  Assumming you used the default database
  storage location the following commands should be all that are needed
  (you'll want to make sure to stop Jabberd2 first):

      cd /var/lib/jabberd2/db
      db4.1_recover

  Now you should be able to start Jabberd2.  I apologize for this
  inconvenience and hope to have this corrected soon.
